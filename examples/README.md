# Examples

Contains example wallet data and auto-generated state files from demo setup scripts.

## Files

- `xrpl-wallets-testnet.json` — Example wallet configuration for testnet
- `setup-state-<network>-<date>.json` — Generated by `scripts/setup-full-state.sh`; consumed by `scripts/make-market.sh`

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Start the dev server
pnpm dev

# 2. Bootstrap a demo environment (output lands here)
scripts/setup-full-state.sh

# 3. Populate the DEX orderbook (auto-reads latest state file from here)
scripts/make-market.sh
```

## State File Format

Generated state files contain funded wallet credentials and look like:

```json
{
  "network": "testnet",
  "issuer":            { "address": "r...", "seed": "s...", "publicKey": "..." },
  "credentialIssuer":  { "address": "r...", "seed": "s...", "publicKey": "..." },
  "domainOwner":       { "address": "r...", "seed": "s...", "publicKey": "..." },
  "currencies": ["XCAD", "XTHB"],
  "recipients": [
    { "address": "r...", "seed": "s...", "publicKey": "..." },
    { "address": "r...", "seed": "s...", "publicKey": "..." }
  ]
}
```

> **Note:** State files contain testnet/devnet wallet seeds. These are not real funds, but avoid committing them to shared repos.
