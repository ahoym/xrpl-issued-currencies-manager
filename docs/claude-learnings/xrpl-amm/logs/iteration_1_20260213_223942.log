The first task is complete. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

**Iteration 1 Complete: Research & Document XRPL AMM**

Created `info.md` with comprehensive documentation covering:
- **Overview**: XLS-30 amendment, constant product formula, one-AMM-per-pair rule
- **AMM Account & LP Tokens**: Special account mechanics, LP token currency code format, initial issuance formula
- **AMM Ledger Entry**: All fields documented
- **All 6 Transaction Types**: AMMCreate, AMMDeposit, AMMWithdraw, AMMVote, AMMBid, AMMDelete — with actual xrpl.js v4.5.0 TypeScript interfaces and flag enums
- **`amm_info` API**: Request/response structure with all fields
- **CLOB DEX Integration**: Synthetic offer injection, automatic routing, pathfinding
- **Impermanent Loss Mitigation**: Auction slot, fee accumulation, LP burn
- **8 Areas for Deeper Investigation** identified, 6 added as pending deep research tasks

Key finding: All AMM types are confirmed available in the project's `xrpl` v4.5.0 dependency. No AMM code exists yet — this is greenfield.
