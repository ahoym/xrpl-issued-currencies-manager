The deep research task is complete. Here's a summary of what was accomplished in this iteration:

**Completed: Deep Research — AMM Error Handling & Edge Cases**

Created `amm-error-handling.md` with:
- **7 AMM-specific tec codes** (162–168) with descriptions and applicable transactions
- **Per-transaction error maps** for AMMCreate (11 codes), AMMDeposit (10 codes), AMMWithdraw (9 codes), and amm_info (2 codes)
- **User-friendly message suggestions** for each error code
- **6 edge cases** documented: frozen assets, empty pool state, pool deletion/trust line cleanup, rounding/minimum amounts, single-asset fee impact, concurrent operation race conditions
- **Recommended error handling pattern** using per-route error maps (matching existing `transfers/route.ts` pattern)

**Key correction discovered**: AMMCreate costs **0.2 XRP** (not 2 XRP) after the 2024 reserve reduction. Updated all 5 artifacts that referenced the old value.

**Cross-references updated**: info.md, assumptions-and-questions.md (added A12-A14), implementation-plan.md (Tasks 2.1-2.3), codebase-summary.md.

**Remaining**: 1 pending task (AMM discovery deep research).
