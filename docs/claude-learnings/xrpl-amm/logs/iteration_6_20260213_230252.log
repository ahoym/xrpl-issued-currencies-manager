## Iteration 6 Complete

**Task completed**: Deep Research: AMM discovery patterns → `amm-discovery.md`

**Key findings**:

1. **`book_offers` / `getOrderbook()` do NOT include AMM liquidity** — synthetic offers are injected at the payment engine layer during transaction execution, not at the API query layer. The AMM Pool Panel is essential for users to see AMM depth.

2. **User LP position discovery**: `account_lines` → filter `0x03`-prefix currencies → each LP token's issuer IS the AMM pseudo-account → call `amm_info` with `amm_account` to get the pool's pair and reserves.

3. **LP token currency codes are not reversible** (SHA-256 hash). Must use `amm_info` lookups.

4. **No changes needed to the implementation plan** — the pair-based discovery approach (Task 1.4) is sufficient for the initial build. User position discovery is documented as future enhancement #7.

**Cross-references updated**: info.md (area #5 resolved), assumptions-and-questions.md (A15-A17 added), implementation-plan.md (future enhancements #7, #9), codebase-summary.md (gotchas #10-#11).

**All research tasks are complete.** The loop is marked `WOOT_COMPLETE_WOOT` — 4 blocking questions (Q1-Q4) require user judgment before implementation can begin.
